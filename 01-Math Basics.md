# Math Basics

Notes that I remember from teaching Algebra (and Geometry, and Algebra II).

* Math follows rules.  Learn the rules and math the answer will always be right.
* Math follows standards.  Follow the standards at all times.
* There is always a "next step" or you're done.  If you don't remember the next step, ask.  It saves time.
* Write down what you're doing.  Even if you finish the problem in your head, write it down.  If I can't figure out what you did from reading your notes, it's not right.
* How you get the answer is more important than the answer.

The first two rules were easy for my autistic student.  The rest, not so much.

The 3rd rule, "There is always a 'next step'" took a while.  He would stare at the problem doing nothing; when I asked him what he was doing he always replied that he was thinking.  This was the reason for coming up with this rule.  It still took awhile befor he would ask for help.

4th rule is a work in progress.  Computer based learning doesn't care if you show your work or not.  However, I require work to be shown for homework assignmments and while tutoring.  Also any wrong answers to the computer based learning tests I require him to show me how he got the answer before answering the question the second time.

The fifth rule I've been hammering into his head for years.  My student tends to guess; since the math questions tend to use small numbers, he "sees" a pattern where the answer is some variation on a single digit (e.g. $(x-4)$ or $5^2$).  To combat this guessing, I include home questions that have answers that are large numbers or fractional (e.g. $(x-29)$ or $`13^{5}`$).  Big numbers don't matter if you just follow the process.

As the teacher/tutor, it's very important to follow these rules.  I remind my student that he needs to tell me if I don't follow my own rules.  As incentitive, he gets off school 15min early every time he catches me breaking my own rules.  At this point he *knows* the rules
