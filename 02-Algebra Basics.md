# Algebra Basics

## Math Notation

### Addition, Lots of Addition

*Every* equation is two lists of terms summed up with a comparison operator between them.

These are the most common comparison operators:

$=\ \gt\ \geq\ \leq\ \lt$

Here's a simple algebraic rule for addition:

$$
\begin{align} \\
a+b &= b+a \\
3+2 &= 2+3
\end{align}
$$

Works great for addition.  The *order* doesn't matter.

### There is No Such Thing as Subtraction

Here's the rule for "*subtraction*":

$$
\begin{align} \\
a-b&=a+(-b) \\
3-2&=3+(-2) \\
\end{align}
$$


$$
\begin{align} \\
a+b &= b+a \\
3+(-2)&=(-2)+3 \\
\end{align}
$$

Read as $a$ minus $b$ equals $a$ plus negative $b$.  *Subtraction* is just adding a negative.  Why is this useful?


After this rule is introduced, students do not use the "minus" or "subtract" word.  That statement equals 3 plus negative 2.  "Minus" is a forbidden word.

### Adding Negative Numbers

Rule:  a+b=b+a

Example:  3+(-2)=(-2)+3

Negative numbers can now be added in any order.  Reinforcement of the negative number addition rule.  "3+(-2)" is the same as "3-2" but we're using extra symbols to turn everything into addition, and if everything is addition then the order doesnt matter.

### An Expression is Just the Addition of Terms



### Every Term Has a Coefficient

Rule:  a+b=1a+1b

Rule:  -a=(-1)(a)

Example:  3+2=(1)(3)+(1)(2)

Example:  3-2=(1)(3)+(-1)(2)

Example:  -(2x+3)=(-1)(2x+3)

Positive terms have a default coefficient of 1, negative terms have a default coefficient of negative 1.  Unary minus is simply a negative 1 times the terms in parentheses.

This comes in handy for complicated expressions such as -x^3-4x^2+x when x=-2:

(-1)x^3 + -4(x^2) + x

(-1)-8 + -4(4) + -2

 8 + -16 + -2
      
 6 + -16
      
 -10

We write "27" as "27".  Why don't we write it as $\frac{27}{1}$ or $27.000$ or $+27$?  Even better:

$$(+1)\cdot\frac{(+27.000)}{(+1)}\cdot(+10)^{0}$$

In math we simplify terms as much as possible.  This means assuming values are positive unless there's a negative sign.  Changing fractions to whole numbers when possible.  Eliminating redundant parts of the expressions that don't alter the value.

One of the things I teach is that there is no such thing as subtraction.  An expression like $3-2$ is actually $(+3)+(-2)$ and signs expand following the rules learned with negative numbers (e.g. like signs are "+" and opposing signs are "-").  We take "shortcuts" by converting adjacent signs to a single sign (e.g. $3x+-5$ to $3x-5$).  Other shortcuts use an implied notation, for exmple $2x\cdot x$ is actually $2x\cdot1x$ where we leave out the implied coefficient of 1.  Also $x$ is $x^1$ which is also implied.  Being able to undo the shortcuts enables easier math operations.

Way back in grade school everyone learned that you can change the order for addition but not for subtraction.

```math
\displaylines{
a+b=b+a \\
a=3, b=2 \\
3+2=2+3 \\
a=4, b=-2 \\
4+-2=-2+4
}
```
But $4+-2$ isn't proper notation.  
-----

```math
\displaylines{
4-(-x-2)      \\
4+-(-x-2)     \\
4+(-1)(-x-2)  \\
4+(-x(-1)-2(-1)) \\
4+(+x+2)      \\
4++x+2        \\
4+x+2         \\
x+6
}
```

### Symbols, Coefficients, Terms

#### Symbols

Algebra is symbol manipulation.  So what is a symbol?  A mathmatical "symbol" is a number or a variable.

Numeric symbols identify the value they represent.  The number $"3"$ has a value of three.  We grew up with using numbers this way so the defenition of a number seems obvious.

In math, we use letters as variables.  While a number is a _known_ amount, a variable is an _unknown_ amout.  A variable $"x"$ is unknown amount.  If we knew what it was, we would use the number.

#### Coefficients

Every symbol has a coefficient even if we don't see one.  Coefficients are just math symbols multiplied against a variable.  For example:

$$
\begin{align} \\
&x = 1 \times x \\
&x = \frac{1}{1} \times x &&= \frac{x}{1} \\
\end{align}
$$

Then there are coefficients used with variables

### Expressions, Equations







## Identity Operations

An *Identity Operation* is a math operation the doesn't change the value.  There are two kinds of identity, additive (anything equivalent of adding zero) and multiplicative (anything equivalent of multiplying by one).

Simples example would be:

$$27=27+0$$

$$27=27\cdot1$$

More complex examples would be:

$$27=27+0^5$$

$$27=27\cdot9^0$$

The identity rule says "equivalent to zero" and "equivalent to one".  In the complex examples above, $0^5=0$ and $9^0=1$ which means they're equivalent to the simple examples.
